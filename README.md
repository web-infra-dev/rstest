Rstest is a testing framework powered by Rspack. It delivers comprehensive, first-class support for the Rspack ecosystem, enabling seamless integration into existing Rspack-based projects.

Rstest offers full Jest-compatible APIs while providing native, out-of-the-box support for TypeScript, ESM, and more, ensuring a modern and efficient testing experience.

## 💡 Current status

Rstest is currently much under active development, there are no published npm packages available at this time.

We welcome developers to clone the repository and [run it locally](./CONTRIBUTING.md) to explore its features as they are being developed. You can check some available [examples](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/rstest/tree/main/examples) in the repository to see how it works.

We plan to release a preview version for testing by June 2025, followed by the first stable release later in 2025.

## 🙏 Credits

Rstest has been inspired by several outstanding projects in the community. We would like to acknowledge and express our sincere gratitude to the following projects:

- Several API design patterns have been influenced by [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/).
- Some functions in Rstest are referenced from Vitest, such as the `expect` and `expect.poll` API, etc.

# Rstest

The testing framework powered by Rspack.

**Rstest is currently much under active development, there are no published NPM packages available at this time. Interested developers can clone and [run locally](./CONTRIBUTING.md) to try out things as they become available.**

You can check some available [examples](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/rstest/tree/main/examples) in the repository to see how it works.

## 🙏 Credits

Some of the implementations of Rstest have drawn inspiration from outstanding projects in the community. We would like to express our gratitude to them:

- The design of some APIs is referenced from [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/).

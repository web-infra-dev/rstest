Rstest is a testing framework powered by Rspack. It delivers comprehensive, first-class support for the Rspack ecosystem, enabling seamless integration into existing Rspack-based projects.

Rstest offers full Jest-compatible APIs while providing native, out-of-the-box support for TypeScript, ESM, and more, ensuring a modern and efficient testing experience.

## 🔥 Roadmap

Rstest is currently under active development and we plan to release the first stable version in late 2025.

More details can be found on [Rstest Roadmap](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/rstest/issues/85).

## 🦀 Rstack

## 🙏 Credits

Rstest has been inspired by several outstanding projects in the community. We would like to acknowledge and express our sincere gratitude to the following projects:

- Several API design patterns have been influenced by [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/).
- Some functions in Rstest are referenced from Vitest, such as the `expect`, `expect.poll` and `snapshot` API, etc.

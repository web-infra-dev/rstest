# disableConsoleIntercept

- **Type:** `boolean`
- **Default:** `false`
- **CLI:** `--disableConsoleIntercept`

Disable interception of console logs. By default, Rstest intercepts the console log, which will help track log sources.

If you don't want Rstest to intercept console logs, you can set this configuration to `true`. It should be noted that when you disable interception of console logs, the `onConsoleLog` and `printConsoleTrace` configurations will not take effect.

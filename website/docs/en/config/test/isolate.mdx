# isolate

- **Type:** `boolean`
- **Default:** `true`
- **CLI:** `--isolate=false`

Run tests in an isolated environment.

By default, Rstest runs each test in an isolated environment, which avoids the impact of some module side effects and helps improve the stability of the test.

If your code has no side effects, turning off this option will help improve performance because module caches can be reused between different test files.

```ts title="rstest.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@rstest/core';

export default defineConfig({
  isolate: false,
});
```

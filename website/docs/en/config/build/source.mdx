# source

Options for input source code.

## source.decorators <RsbuildDocBadge path="/config/source/decorators" text="source.decorators" />

Used to configure the decorators syntax.

## source.define <RsbuildDocBadge path="/config/source/define" text="source.define" />

Replaces variables in your code with other values or expressions at compile time. This can be useful for injecting env variables and other information to the code during build time.

## source.exclude <RsbuildDocBadge path="/config/source/exclude" text="source.exclude" />

Exclude JavaScript or TypeScript files that do not need to be transformed by [SWC](https://rsbuild.rs/guide/configuration/swc).

::: note

Files configured in `source.exclude` will not be transformed by SWC, but the referenced files will still be bundled into the outputs.

If you want certain files not to be bundled into the outputs, you can use [output.externals](/config/build/output#outputexternals) or Rspack's [IgnorePlugin](https://rspack.rs/plugins/webpack/ignore-plugin).

:::

## source.include <RsbuildDocBadge path="/config/source/include" text="source.include" />

Specify additional JavaScript files that need to be compiled.

## source.tsconfigPath <RsbuildDocBadge path="/config/source/tsconfig-path" text="source.tsconfigPath" />

Configure a custom `tsconfig.json` file path to use, can be a relative or absolute path.

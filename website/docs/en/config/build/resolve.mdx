# resolve

Options for module resolution.

## resolve.aliasStrategy <RsbuildDocBadge path="/config/resolve/alias-strategy" text="resolve.aliasStrategy" />

Control the priority between the `resolve.alias` option and the `paths` option in `tsconfig.json`.

## resolve.alias <RsbuildDocBadge path="/config/resolve/alias" text="resolve.alias" />

Set the alias for the module path, which is used to simplify the import path or redirect the module reference, similar to the [resolve.alias](https://rspack.rs/config/resolve#resolvealias) config of Rspack.

For TypeScript projects, you only need to configure [compilerOptions.paths](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#paths) in the `tsconfig.json` file. Rstest will automatically recognize it, so there is no need to configure the `resolve.alias` option separately.

## resolve.dedupe <RsbuildDocBadge path="/config/resolve/dedupe" text="resolve.dedupe" />

Force Rstest to resolve the specified packages from project root, which is useful for deduplicating packages and reducing the bundle size.

## resolve.extensions <RsbuildDocBadge path="/config/resolve/extensions" text="resolve.extensions" />

Automatically resolve file extensions when importing modules. This means you can import files without explicitly writing their extensions.

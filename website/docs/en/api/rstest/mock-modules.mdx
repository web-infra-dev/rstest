# Mock modules

Rstest supports mocking modules, which allows you to replace the implementation of modules in tests. Rstest provides utility functions in `rs` (`rstest`) for mocking modules. You can directly use the following methods to mock modules:

## rs.mock

- **Type**: `<T = unknown>(moduleName: string | Promise<T>, moduleFactory?: (() => Partial<T>)) => void`

When calling `rs.mock`, Rstest will mock and replace the module specified in the first parameter. `rs.mock` will determine how to handle the mocked module based on whether a second mock factory function is provided, as explained in detail below.

**Note that:** `rs.mock` is hoisted to the top of the current module, so even if you execute `import fn from 'some_module'` before calling `rs.mock('some_module')`, `some_module` will be mocked from the beginning.

Based on the second parameter provided, `rs.mock` has two behaviors:

1. If a factory function is provided as the second parameter to `rs.mock`, the module will be replaced with the return value of the factory function as the implementation of the mocked module.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', gap: '1rem' }}>
  <div>
    ```ts title="src/sum.test.ts"
    import { sum } from './sum';

    rs.mock('./sum', () => {
      return {
        sum: (a: number, b: number) => a + b + 100,
      };
    });

    expect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(103); // PASS
    ```

</div>
  <div>
    ```ts title="src/sum.ts"
    export const sum = (a: number, b: number) => a + b;

    ```

  </div>
</div>

2. If `rs.mock` is called without providing a factory function, it will attempt to resolve a module with the same name in the `__mocks__` directory at the same level as the mocked module. The specific mock resolution rules are as follows:
   1. If the mocked module is not an npm dependency, and there is a `__mocks__` folder at the same level as the file being mocked, where the `__mocks__` folder contains a file with the same name as the mocked module, Rstest will use that file as the mock implementation.
   2. If the mocked module is an npm dependency, and there is a `__mocks__` folder in the root directory that contains a file with the same name as the mocked module, Rstest will use that file as the mock implementation.
   3. If the mocked module is a Node.js built-in module (such as `fs`, `path`, etc.), and there is a `__mocks__` folder in the root directory that contains a file with the same name as the built-in module (e.g., `__mocks__/fs.mjs`, `__mocks__/path.ts`, etc.), Rstest will use that file as the corresponding mock implementation (when using the `node:` protocol to import built-in modules, the `node:` prefix will be ignored).

   For example, if the project has the following file structure:

   ```txt
   ├── __mocks__
   │   └── lodash.js
   ├── src
   │   ├── multiple.ts
   │   └── __mocks__
   │       └── multiple.ts
   └── __test__
       └── multiple.test.ts
   ```

   Then in the following test file, when trying to mock the `lodash` and `src/multiple` modules, they will be replaced with implementations from `__mocks__/lodash.js` and `src/__mocks__/multiple.ts`.

   ```ts title="src/multiple.test.ts"
   import { rs } from '@rstest/core';

   // lodash is a default export from `__mocks__/lodash.js`
   import lodash from 'lodash';

   // multiple is a named export from `src/__mocks__/multiple.ts`
   import { multiple } from '../src/multiple';

   rs.mock('lodash');
   rs.mock('../src/multiple');

   lodash.random(multiple(1, 2), multiple(3, 4));
   ```

   `rs.mock` and `rs.doMock` also support passing a `Promise<T>` as the first parameter, and use the type `T` as the return value type of the second factory function after awaiting (`Promise<T>`). This provides better type hints in IDEs and type validation for the factory function's return value. Passing `Promise<T>` only enhances type hints and has no impact on the module mocking capabilities.

   ```ts
   // Compared to rs.mock('../src/b', ...) the type is enhanced.
   rs.mock(import('../src/b'), () => {
     return {
       b: 222,
     };
   });
   ```

## rs.doMock

- **Type**: `<T = unknown>(moduleName: string | Promise<T>, moduleFactory?: (() => Partial<T>)) => void`

Similar to `rs.mock`, `rs.doMock` also mocks modules, but it is not hoisted to the top of the module. It is called when it's executed, which means that if a module has already been imported before calling `rs.doMock`, that module will not be mocked, while modules imported after calling `rs.doMock` will be mocked.

    ```ts title="src/sum.test.ts"
    import { rs } from '@rstest/core';
    import { sum } from './sum';

    it('test', async () => {
        // sum is imported before executing doMock, it's not mocked yet
        expect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(3); // PASS
        rs.doMock('./sum')
        const { sum: mockedSum } = await import('./sum');
        // sum is imported after executing doMock, it's mocked now
        expect(mockedSum(1, 2)).toBe(3); // FAILED
    })
    ```

## rs.hoisted

- **Type**: `<T = unknown>(fn: () => T) => T`

`rs.hoisted` is a helper function that allows you to create values that can be accessed in hoisted functions like `rs.mock` factory functions. Like `rs.mock`, `rs.hoisted` is also hoisted to the top of the module, and it provides access to the `rs` utilities within the hoisted scope.

This is useful when you need to create mock functions or values that should be shared between the mock factory function and your test code.

```ts title="src/sum.test.ts"
import { expect, it, rs } from '@rstest/core';
import { foo } from './sum';

// `rs` utilities can be accessed in hoisted function.
const mocks = rs.hoisted(() => {
  return {
    hoistedFn: rs.fn(),
  };
});

rs.mock('./sum', () => {
  return { foo: mocks.hoistedFn };
});

it('hoisted', () => {
  mocks.hoistedFn(42);
  expect(mocks.hoistedFn).toHaveBeenCalledOnce();
  expect(mocks.hoistedFn).toHaveBeenCalledWith(42);
  expect(foo).toBe(mocks.hoistedFn);
});
```

In this example, `rs.hoisted` allows you to create a mock function using `rs.fn()` that can be used both in the `rs.mock` factory function and in your test assertions. Without `rs.hoisted`, you would not be able to access `rs` utilities in the scope where `rs.mock` factory functions are evaluated.

{/* ## TODO: rs.mocked */}

## rs.importActual

- **Type**: `<T = Record<string, unknown>>(path: string) => Promise<T>`

Loads the original implementation of a module even if it has already been mocked. Use `rs.importActual` when you want a partial mock so you can merge the real exports with your overrides.

```ts title="src/sum.test.ts"
rs.mock('./sum');

it('test', async () => {
  const actualModule = await rs.importActual('./sum');
  expect(actualModule.sum(1, 2)).toBe(3);
});
```

Rstest also exposes a synchronous `importActual` option for static imports. Add the [import attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import/with) `with { rstest: 'importActual' }` to load the real module as the file evaluates:

```ts title="src/api.test.ts"
import * as apiActual from './api' with { rstest: 'importActual' };

// Partially mock the './api' module
rs.mock('./api', () => ({
  ...apiActual,
  fetchUser: rs.fn().mockResolvedValue({ id: 'mocked' }),
}));
```

## rs.importMock

- **Type**: `<T = Record<string, unknown>>(path: string) => Promise<T>`

Imports a module and all its properties as mock implementations.

```ts title="src/sum.test.ts"
it('test', async () => {
  const mockedModule = await rs.importMock('./sum');
  expect(mockedModule.sum2(1, 2)).toBe(103);
});
```

## rs.unmock

- **Type**: `(path: string) => void`

Cancels the mock implementation of the specified module. After this, all calls to `import` will return the original module, even if it was previously mocked. Like `rs.mock`, this call is hoisted to the top of the file, so it will only cancel module mocks executed in `setupFiles`.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', gap: '1rem' }}>
  <div>
    ```ts title="src/sum.test.ts"
    import { rs } from '@rstest/core';
    import { sum } from './src/sum';

    rs.unmock('./src/sum');

    expect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(3); // PASS
    ```

</div>
  <div>
    ```ts title="rstest.setup.ts"
    import { rs } from '@rstest/core'
    ;
    rs.mock('./src/sum', () => {
      return {
        sum: (a: number, b: number) => a + b + 100,
      };
    });

    ```

  </div>
</div>

## rs.doUnmock

- **Type**: `(path: string) => void`

Same as `rs.unmock`, but it is not hoisted to the top of the file. The next import of the module will import the original module instead of the mock. This will not cancel modules that were imported before the mock.

## rs.resetModules

- **Type**: `resetModules: () => RstestUtilities`

Clears the cache of all modules. This allows modules to be re-executed when re-imported. This is useful for isolating the state of modules shared between different tests.

:::warning
Does not reset mocked modules. To clear mocked modules, use [`rs.unmock`](#rsunmock) or [`rs.doUnmock`](#rsdounmock).

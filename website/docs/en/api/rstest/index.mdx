# Rstest utility

Rstest provides utility functions to help you out through its `rstest` helper.

You can import it from `@rstest/core` directly, and you can also use its alias `rs`.

```ts
import { rstest } from '@rstest/core';

const fn = rstest.fn();
fn.mockResolvedValue('foo');
```

Or, you can access it globally like `jest` (when [globals](/config/test/globals) configuration is enabled).

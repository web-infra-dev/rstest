# CLI

Rstest comes with a lightweight CLI that includes commands such as [rstest watch](#rstest-watch) and [rstest run](#rstest-run).

## rstest -h

`rstest -h` can help you view all available CLI commands and options:

```bash
npx rstest -h
```

The output is shown below:

```bash
Usage:
  $ rstest [...filters]

Commands:
  [...filters]        run tests
  run [...filters]    run tests without watch mode
  watch [...filters]  run tests in watch mode
  list [...filters]   lists all test files that Rstest will run

Options:
  -h, --help                               Display this message
  -v, --version                            Display version number
  -c, --config <config>
  ...
```

## rstest [...filters]

Running `rstest` directly will enable the Rstest test in the current directory. Listening mode is automatically entered in the development environment (equivalent to `rstest watch`), while a single test is performed in the CI environment or non-terminal interactive mode (equivalent to `rstest run`).

```bash
$ npx rstest

âœ“ test/index.test.ts (2 tests) 1ms

  Test Files 1 passed (1)
       Tests 2 passed (2)
    Duration 189 ms (build 22 ms, tests 167 ms)
```

## rstest run

`rstest run` will perform a single run, and the command is suitable for CI environments or scenarios where tests are not required to be performed while modifying.

## rstest watch

`rstest watch` will start listening mode and execute tests, and when the test or dependent file modifications, the associated test file will be re-execute.

## rstest list

`rstest list` will print a test list of all matching conditions. By default, it prints the test names of all matching tests.

```bash
$ npx rstest list

# the output is shown below:
a.test.ts > test a > test a-1
a.test.ts > test a-2
b.test.ts > test b > test b-1
b.test.ts > test b-2
```

The `rstest list` command inherits all `rstest` filtering options, you can filter files directly or use `-t` to filter the specified test name.

```bash
$ npx rstest list -t='test a'

# the output is shown below:
a.test.ts > test a > test a-1
a.test.ts > test a-2
```

You can use `--filesOnly` to make it print the test files only:

```bash
$ npx rstest list --filesOnly

# the output is shown below:
a.test.ts
b.test.ts
```

You can use `--json` to make it print tests in JSON format in terminal or save the results to a separate file:

```bash
$ npx rstest list --json

$ npx rstest list --json=./output.json
```

# Filtering tests

Rstest provides a variety of flexible ways to filter and select which test files and test cases to run. You can precisely control the test scope via configuration files, command-line arguments, and test APIs.

## Filter by file name

Run all tests:

```bash
rstest
```

Run a specific test file:

```bash
rstest test/foo.test.ts
```

Use glob patterns:

```bash
rstest test/**/*.test.ts
```

Run test files with `foo` in the name, such as `foo.test.ts`, `foo/index.test.ts`, `foo-bar/index.test.ts`, etc.:

```bash
rstest foo
```

You can also specify multiple test files or glob patterns:

```bash
rstest test/foo.test.ts test/bar.test.ts
```

### Filter by file path

This method also applies to filtering by file path.

When filtering by file path, it can be either an absolute path or a relative path based on the current working directory (also called the project root directory or workspace root directory)

```bash
# Filtering by absolute path
rstest /Users/userName/Desktop/projects/rstest/packages/core/tests/index.test.ts

# Filtering by relative path
rstest packages/core/tests/index.test.ts

# Filtering by project directory
rstest packages/core
```

### include/exclude

When you filter files directly with `rstest **/*.test.ts`, rstest will further filter files based on the [include](/config/test/include) and [exclude](/config/test/exclude) configuration.
You can modify the test file scope using the `include` and `exclude` options.

For example, to match test files named `index` in the `test/a` directory:

```bash
rstest index --include test/a/*.test.ts
```

To match test files in `test/a` or `test/b` directories:

```bash
rstest --include test/a/*.test.ts --include test/b/*.test.ts
```

## Filter by test name

If you only want to run test cases whose names contain a specific keyword, you can use [testNamePattern](/config/test/testNamePattern).

For example, to only run test cases whose names contain "login":

```bash
rstest --testNamePattern login
# or
rstest -t login
```

## Combined filtering

All filtering methods can be combined. For example:

```bash
rstest test/**/*.test.ts --exclude test/legacy/** --testNamePattern login
```

In this case, rstest will only run test cases whose names contain login in all `.test.ts` files under the `test` directory, while excluding the `test/legacy` directory.

## Common usage

- **Run a specific file only**: `rstest test/foo.test.ts`

- **Run tests in a specific directory only**: `rstest test/api/*.test.ts`

- **Exclude certain tests**: `rstest --exclude test/legacy/**`

- **Run only tests whose names contain login**: `rstest -t login`

- **Combined filtering**: `rstest test/**/*.test.ts --exclude test/legacy/** --testNamePattern login`

## Filter via test API

Use the `.only` modifier to run only certain test suites or cases.

For example, only the test cases in `suite A` and `case A` will be run:

```ts
describe.only('suite A', () => {
  // ...
});

describe('suite B', () => {
  // ...
});

test.only('case A', () => {
  // ...
});

test('case B', () => {
  // ...
});
```

:::note
It should be noted that the `.only` flag only applies to the current test file. If you want to execute specific test cases within a specific file, you can use a combination of "filter by file name" and "filter via test API".
:::

Use `.skip` or `.todo` to skip certain test suites or cases.

```ts
describe.skip('suite A', () => {
  // ...
});

test.todo('case A', () => {
  // ...
});
```

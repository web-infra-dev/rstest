# Upgrade Rstest

This section explains how to upgrade the project's Rstest dependencies to the latest version.

:::info

Rstest is still in 0.x version stage, and the API may change frequently. We recommend upgrading to the latest version to access new features and bug fixes.

:::

## Using taze

We recommend using [Taze](https://github.com/antfu-collective/taze) to upgrade the Rstest version. Taze is a CLI tool for updating npm dependencies.

### Usage

Run the following command to upgrade all dependencies that include `rstest` and `rsbuild` in their names:

```bash
npx taze major --include "/(rstest|rsbuild)/" -w
```

:::tip
Rstest has not yet reached version 1.0.0, so you need to add the `major` parameter when updating.
:::

The result will look similar to:

```bash
rstest-example - 1 patch

  devDependencies
    @rstest/core    ~29d  ^0.6.0  →  ^0.6.6  ~5d

ℹ changes written to package.json, run pnpm i to install updates.
```

You can also adjust the `include` pattern to match specific packages, for example, to upgrade only packages under the `@rstest` scope:

```bash
npx taze --include /@rstest/ -w
```

### Options

Here are some examples of using taze options.

- In a monorepo, you can add the `-r` option to upgrade recursively:

```bash
npx taze --include /(rstest|rsbuild)/ -w -r
```

- Add `-l` to upgrade locked versions:

```bash
npx taze --include /(rstest|rsbuild)/ -w -l
```

- To upgrade to a major version:

```bash
npx taze major --include /(rstest|rsbuild)/ -w
```

> For more options, please refer to the [taze documentation](https://github.com/antfu-collective/taze).

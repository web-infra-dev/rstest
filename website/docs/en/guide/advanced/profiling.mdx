# Profiling

## Using Rsdoctor

[Rsdoctor](https://rsdoctor.rs/) is a build analysis tool that can visually display the compilation time of each loaders and plugins.

When you need to debug Rstest's build outputs or build processes, you can use Rsdoctor for troubleshooting.

### Quick start

In Rstest, you can enable Rsdoctor analysis as follows:

1. Install the Rsdoctor plugin:

import { PackageManagerTabs } from '@theme';

<PackageManagerTabs command="add @rsdoctor/rspack-plugin -D" />

2. Add `RSDOCTOR=true` env variable before the CLI command:

```json title="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "test:rsdoctor": "RSDOCTOR=true rstest run"
  }
}
```

As Windows does not support the above usage, you can also use [cross-env](https://npmjs.com/package/cross-env) to set environment variables. This ensures compatibility across different systems:

```json title="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "test:rsdoctor": "cross-env RSDOCTOR=true rstest run"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "cross-env": "^7.0.0"
  }
}
```

After running the above commands, Rstest will automatically register the Rsdoctor plugin, and after the build is completed, it will open the build analysis page. For complete features, please refer to [Rsdoctor document](https://rsdoctor.rs/).

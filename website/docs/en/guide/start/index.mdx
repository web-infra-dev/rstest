# Introduction

Rstest is a testing framework powered by Rspack. It delivers comprehensive, first-class support for the Rspack ecosystem, enabling seamless integration into existing Rspack-based projects.

Rstest offers full Jest-compatible APIs while providing native, out-of-the-box support for TypeScript, ESM, and more, ensuring a modern and efficient testing experience.

## üí° Current status

Rstest is currently much under active development, there are no published npm packages available at this time.

We welcome developers to clone the repository and [run it locally](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/rstest/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) to explore its features as they are being developed. You can check some available [examples](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/rstest/tree/main/examples) in the repository to see how it works.

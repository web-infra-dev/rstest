# Quick start

## Setup environment

Before getting started, you will need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) >= 18, it is recommended to use the Node.js LTS version.

Check the current Node.js version with the following command:

```bash
node -v
```

If you do not have Node.js installed in current environment, or the installed version is too low, you can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) to install.

Here is an example of how to install via nvm:

```bash
# Install Node.js LTS
nvm install --lts
# Switch to Node.js LTS
nvm use --lts
```

## Using Rstest

You can install Rstest using the following command:

import { PackageManagerTabs } from '@theme';

<PackageManagerTabs command="add @rstest/core -D" />

Next, you need to update the npm scripts in your package.json to use Rstest's CLI commands.

```json title=package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "rstest"
  }
}
```

After completing the above steps, you can run the Rstest tests using `npm run test`, `yarn test`, or `pnpm test`. Alternatively, you can directly use `npx rstest` to execute the Rstest tests.

Rstest has built-in commands such as `watch` and `run`, please refer to [CLI Tools](/guide/basic/cli) to learn about all available commands and options.

## Writing tests

As a simple example, we have a `sayHi` method. To test it, you can create a test file called `index.test.ts` or use In-Source test similar to [Rust Test](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch11-03-test-organization.html#the-tests-module-and-cfgtest).

```ts file=index.ts
export const sayHi = () => 'hi';
```

```ts file=index.test.ts
import { expect, test } from '@rstest/core';
import { sayHi } from '../src/index';

test('should sayHi correctly', () => {
  expect(sayHi()).toBe('hi');
});
```

Next, you can execute the test by using the command configured in [Using Rstest](#using-rstest). Rstest will print the following message:

```bash
 âœ“ test/index.test.ts (1)

 Test Files 1 passed
      Tests 1 passed
   Duration 140 ms (build 17 ms, tests 123 ms)
```

/**
 * Live per-file API binding under `isolate: false` (the canonical contract).
 *
 * One worker runs many files: `@rstest/core`'s runtime is re-prepared per file
 * (#1373) but user modules persist, so any context-bound API value-copied into
 * a shared helper (`export const test = base.extend({})`, `{ ...rstest }`, a
 * snapshotted `expect.poll`) must not freeze to the first file's torn-down
 * context. ONE mechanism covers the whole surface: every injected member is
 * built once per worker with a stable identity and resolves the running file's
 * `FileContext` (`../fileContext`) at call time — never closing over a
 * per-file instance. `createRunner` republishes the context per file, and
 * per-file state is reset, not rebuilt:
 *
 *   - test / it / describe / hooks   → `runtimeAPI`            (runner/runtime.ts)
 *   - onTestFinished / onTestFailed  → `runnerAPI`             (runner/index.ts)
 *   - expect (incl. `.poll`/`.soft`) → `createFileExpect`      (./expect)
 *   - rstest / rs                    → `createRstestUtilities` (./utilities)
 *
 * The per-test local expect (`context.expect`) stays pinned to its test. The
 * runner reconciles its assertion bookkeeping with the file singleton for
 * sequential tests, while concurrent tests keep local-only state.
 *
 * See https://github.com/web-infra-dev/rstest/issues/1376.
